# Linked Lists 

A linked list is a series of nodes with each node having at least a single pointer or reference to the next node, or a null pointer or void reference in the case of the last node.

These implementations of linked lists will contain a head and a tail pointer or reference so that insertion at either head or tail will have a constant time operation.
