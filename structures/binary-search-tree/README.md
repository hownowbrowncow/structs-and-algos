# Binary Search Tree

Start with root node with value of X, insert nodes with values < X in left subtree, and nodes with values >= X in right subtree. Each node follows the same rules with respect to their left and right subtrees.

Binary search trees are faviourably fast: insertion, search, and deletion can be done on O(log n) time, but only when the tree is reasonably balanced.
